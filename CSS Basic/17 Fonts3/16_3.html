        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
        <p>SCC is designed to enable the spartion of content and presntion, iacloding lyout, color, and fonts.This spartion can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specifasion of peresention  characteristics; enable multiple we pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .ess file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the . <span>file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</span> Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
