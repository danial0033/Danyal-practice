        <h1>Ocean</h1>
        <p>The ocean (also known as the sea or the
            world ocean) is a body of salt water that
            covers approximately 70.8% of the Earth and
            contains 97% of Earth's water. The term ocean
            also refers to any of the large bodies of water
            into which the world ocean is conventionally
            divided. Distinct names are used to identify
            five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the
            largest), Atiantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic
            (the smallest) Seawater covers approximately
            361.000.000 km2 (139 000.000 sa mi) of the
            planet. The ocean is the primary component
            of the Barth's hydrosphere, and thus essential
            to life on Earth. The ocean influences climate
            and weather pattems, the carbon cycle, and
            the water cycle by acting as a huge heat
            reservoir</p>
